The NDIS faces growing demand, especially in regional areas where limited service availability leads to plan under-utilisation. South Australia (SA) and Victoria (VIC) both rely heavily on disability supports but differ in population size, participation rates, and regional service capacity. Addressing the business problem is critical for anticipating future funding pressure, improving workforce planning, and reducing inequity in access to supports. This report identifies three challenges: forecasting regional funding growth, determining which states will face the greatest funding strain, and detecting underserved regions. The selected research question examines predicted funding growth in regional SA compared with regional VIC. Using participant, budget, payment, and population datasets, the study applies descriptive analytics and forecasting techniques to support informed resource allocation.# DATA6000
